    <h1>20 Sorce Reseach Summery</h1><br>
    <p>Growing up I feel like I wanted to become like a doll or been told that you are like a doll from one of your relatives; However, actually becoming the doll itself was impossible. Or maybe doll being alive was imposible. Lulu Hashimoto was created by artist call milina, fashion creator in Japan. As an artist, she states that “ART THAT CAN BE WORN. And her is CUTE by girls For girls. lulu just looks like a doll. But actually, she is alive!”. I think what she wants to say is that art pieces don’t stop at the object but continue to our body and our human body can become one of the materials of the object as well. That materiality she is exploring is very interesting to me. Doll, lulu, become alive because there is a human being inside but also that human beings identity will be covered by the doll in someway. But still, the way she moves is affected by the person who is wearing the doll and the creator of the Lulu chose the person who wears Lulu by the occasion (like when it’s for the dancing she chose dancer) and only thing she tell that person is to act like your idea of who is Lulu. So then where are the line of human and doll or line in being alive and being an object And the creator also owns a store that sells the items that are related to the Lulu, so that people need to become a doll is interesting to me too.</p>

    <p>Other is that is interesting to me about Lulu the doll is that idea of “CUTE”. Lulu is made by Millina’s idea of beauty and idea of cuteness. In so many cultures I think Kawaii  (the Japanese word for cute) is described as charming, vulnerable, shy and childlike. But is the idea of cute actually just charming, vulnerable, shy and childlike for Millina and Lulu who stands for the idea of “cute”? In some of the video Millina uploaded on the internet, she talks about how vulnerable and uncomfortable for her to live in the Japanese school where being normal, acting like others were wanted by teachers and how she felt the teacher didn’t even look at her as a human being when she disobeyed that idealistic behavior. I think she gains the power and be able to express herself and what she feels wrong in the society. In another video I watched she talked about how beauty standard in Japan only let people who are born with the beauty to be beautiful. She describes Lulu as the wearable magic, the magic that let her impossible dream come true. She describes the world she lives in as the romantic place that her dreams come true because her idea of beauty resonates with someone else’s idea of beauty. Which shows that the idea of beauty differs in people than what is beauty standard? Also, what is the power of beauty? </p>

    <p>I also read an article Fukusuke Fukuda, a college professor, wrote about Doll Media and how talking about who is in the doll is such a new way to approach. That sensation of the audience feeling like “I could be Lulu too” is a new concept that is interesting and the way this Lulu project could grow. Also, he talks about how in the VR, Game, and Virtual youtube channel people pretend to be beautiful women and how that shows something deeper about that person. </p>

      <p>5. It is like a French doll that lives like a living French doll, covering the head with a doll face doll and wearing tights imitating a spherical joint doll in his or her limbs.</p>

      <p>6. To live her life, to say it is ok to be your self and you will find where you can be you.</p>

      <p>7. Hashimoto Lulu was alive. Writing a signature on my T - shirt or where do you see the front? When I asked, it was such a pretty charming creativity that I was laughing like "being a secret" with such a cute and tiny voice that moved so graciously. If I am not mistake i wonder where she accepts her</p>

      <p>8. I think that there is a possibility of this project in the place that "I may be Lulu Hashimoto as well".</p>

      <p>9. she is someone who was able to make her dream come true. I still have truble being beautiful in the way I define beauty.</p>

      <p>10. Surely it is not an extension of a doll, but an extension of a human being and makeup or fashion.</p>

    <p>I think I saw her story doing research about her. being boxed in the society who tells you have to look like others, act like other, and denided to be indivisual. But she found who she is by meeting to things she felt beautiful, then she moved on to what makes her feel beautiful. With that confort, she feels beauty that she defin, beauty that is personalized to her.</p>

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-64" id="#demoTwo">
    <h4>who they think they are</h4>
    <p>to learn about her and how she, Lulu,thought about her; I went though every tweet she ever made and also when though all the tweet the director ever made. </p>

    <p>I think Lulu is being that aim to be a shell for someone to become who they want to be, one day she is a model, another day she is a dancer. she can never be able to definded perfectly. The term Lulu Hashimoto is a moving, can be changing. Lulu's act and speech change depeands on the person inside she is keep changing, getting effected by things and people she encounters.</p>

    <p>I wanted to forcus how the srtsit in the interview, how Lulu can be you, anyone. She might be just the mask or skin but who is inside matters the most. That is the most part of the project. That is why I wanted to have her face not totally on face but close enogh so it is hard to see your self. I believe we all wear some kind of mask on us to be confortable around people, and that could be Lulu.</p>
